# Dev playground for testing code 

For experimentation, archiving working and once-working code, and code that is not meant for production.

No need for pull requests, if you have access to this, go ahead and push to the default branch.

Also please change the subdirectory names as needed, I just made them with everyone's real names for convenience.
