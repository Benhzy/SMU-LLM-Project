The\\nplatform was founded 6 years ago and is based in Singapore. Its main selling point is a\\nrange of AR ﬁlters called — “perspectives” or “paxes” by the community — which let\\nstreamers superimpose hyper-realistic 3D graphics over real world video. These can be\\nactivated at the click of a button, and streamers generally do not concern themselves with\\nhow they work.\\nThe platform rose to fame because of its dedication towards helping its creators make con-\\ntent (and money) “like magic”. Since the beginning, Witch maintained a “creator ﬁrst”\\npolicy which very publicly declares that all subscription fees “go directly in the ﬁrst in-\\nstance to our content creators; we only take a modest amount to keep the platform run-\\nning”. This modest amount is 10% of the subscription fee viewers pay. Creators alone\\ndecide how much to set these fees at. In this regard, Witch differs from usual platforms\\nwhere, in those other platforms, (1) viewer money goes ﬁrst to the platform which takes\\na cut before disbursing funds to the streamer’s account, (2) average platform fees range\\nbetween 20–30%; and (3) creators are required to charge an amount the platform sets.\\nThe relationship between Witch and its creators is shaped by Witch’s Terms of Use which\\nbinds both creators and viewers alike. The Terms state that Witch is “not responsible for\\nany content our creators publish on our platform”. Nothing else in the Terms is material.\\nAs for Marcela, her success really began in October last year, when she decided to do\\na Halloween special. She streamed herself taking a walk through Bishan-Ang Mo Kio\\npark at night while using one of Witch’s “horror” paxes to make it seem as if every other\\nhuman in the park was some kind of nightly horror — zombies, werewolves, giants, beasts,\\nvampires, and ghosts galore. That stream attracted 50,000 active viewers.\\nBut all that was last year. Since then, Marcela has organised her channel around horror\\nstreams: night visits to the abandoned Old Changi Hospital, mysterious spots in Pulau\\nUbin, etc, all of them enhanced by Witch’s paxes. This has won her dedicated subscriber\\nbase amongst Singapore teens aged 14–20, who enjoy watching her streams with friends\\nat sleepovers and the like.\\n AY2022/23-I\\nLAW 105: Law of Torts\\n3\\nCapitalising on her success, on 12 August 2022 Marcela planned a huge “Seventh Month\\nSpecial”. This coincided with the ﬁrst day of the Lunar seventh month, a date broadly\\nunderstood in Chinese superstition as the day the gates of the Underworld open, allowing\\nits denizens to roam the world of the living. Marcela asked Witch if they could make her\\na “special, extra scary Seventh Month pax which shows extremely realistic ghosts ﬂying\\neverywhere, so that my subscribers get the fright of their lives”. Witch readily agreed, as it\\nwas raring to try out a new AR generation software its engineers had just ﬁnished building.\\nMarcela marketed the event aggressively on her channel, asking her viewers to “invite all\\nyour friends and non-believers to come and witness the true meaning of horror (at your\\nown risk!)”.\\nMarcela then set herself up on 11 August 2022, 2300 hours, in the middle of Lim Chu\\nKang cemetery. Together with her viewers, she counted down to midnight. By 2355\\nhours, her stream had upwards of 250,000 viewers (not including those watching through\\ntheir friends’ accounts). Once the clock struck twelve, Marcela turned the new pax on.\\nWhat transpired was truly the meaning of horror. It turned out that Witch’s engineers had\\nbuilt the new software by training a machine learning algorithm on particularly gruesome\\nand grisly images — the sort that would be banned outright from television. This included\\nreal images of dead, dismembered, and decaying humans and other (previously) living\\nthings. That was how they were able to replicate hyper-realistic, and utterly frightful AR\\nvisions. Witch did not realise that paxes created by this software had the potential to repro-\\nduce the exact same images on their platform (in hyper-realistic 3D no less). Because of a\\ncareless oversight on Witch’s part, the new software did not go through quality assurance\\nor censorship before deployment.\\nThe moment the ﬁlter was enabled, gory images in the software’s training data were in-\\nstantly broadcast to all of Marcela’s viewers, inﬂicting severe distress and emotional dam-\\nage. As she was busy ﬁlming, Marcela did not realise what was happening until a sharp\\nfall in viewer count minutes into the stream prompted her to check what they were seeing.\\nShe immediately turned the ﬁlter off when she did.\\nBy then, however, the damage had been done. Marcela went from expecting 10,000 new\\nsubscribers from that event to losing 250,000 subscribers overnight.\\nThis causes her\\nmonthly subscriber revenue to plunge by $250,000, as she charges $1/month.

Negligence**:\n","\n","* **Rule**: Negligence is a failure to exercise the standard of care expected of a person in a particular situation.\n","* **Application**: If the firm owed a duty of care to A&K and breached that duty by failing to take reasonable steps to ensure the safety of the ‘further’ from the 5th floor, then they could be held liable for the cost of repairs if the firm is found to have been negligent in their work.\n","\n","**2.

Other Torts**:\n","\n","* **Trespass to Land:** If the \"horror\" content was generated by the software without proper authorization, Marcela could potentially sue for trespass if she believes it is a violation of her right to privacy and seclusion. \n","* **Invasion of Privacy:** This situation raises potential issues of invasion of privacy. While the scenario mentions an \"AR filter\" which suggests a digital space, Marcela's \"celeb-status\" as a streamer could be argued to have been violated by the platform if they were allowed to access her viewers through their use of the \"Seventh Month Special\" and other similar situations.\n","* **Intentional Infliction of Emotional Distress:** Depending on the jurisdiction and specific details of the situation, Marcela might have grounds to sue for intentional infliction of emotional distress if she can prove that the actions of the platform's developers in creating a filter with such\n","\n","**It is important to note:**\n","\n","This case highlights how viewers could be exposed to potential legal issues beyond just the issue of negligence. \n","\n","\n","**Here's how these torts might apply**:\n","\n","* **Defamation**: If the \"Seventh Month\" content was harmful and untrue, Marcela could potentially sue for defamation if she can prove that the abandoned cemetery paxes caused her to be ridiculed or held in contempt by others due to its nature.\n","* **Misrepresentation**: If Marcela intentionally misrepresented the nature of the filter's capabilities to her followers (e.g., falsely claiming it was harmless), then the situation might also involve claims of defamation, as the content could be considered fraudulent.**\n","\n","**It is important to note:** This scenario raises complex legal issues regarding the use of “Seventh Month” content for commercial purposes. \n","\n","**Publicity Rights**: If the \"Seventh Month\" software is a form of intellectual property owned by the platform, Marcela's actions are more likely to be subject to legal action.\n","The \"Seventh Month\" filter, as described in the scenario, could be considered a violation of the “Right of Publicity” if it was used for commercial purposes without her consent or permission.\n","\n","**Privacy Rights**: If Marcela is a minor, and the platform's actions are deemed to have violated his/her privacy rights, this could also be grounds for a lawsuit. \n","This scenario highlights the potential for legal issues to arise from the use of “Seventh Month” paxes (if they were used in a commercial context)\n","\n","**Other Considerations**: If the \"ghost\" images were particularly disturbing or offensive, Marcela could potentially face legal consequences if she had used them without proper warnings or disclaimers. \n","\n","Yes, there are several other torts that Marcela could potentially use to sue, even if the platform itself was not responsible for her distress.
