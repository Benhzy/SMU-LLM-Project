The\\nplatform was founded 6 years ago and is based in Singapore. Its main selling point is a\\nrange of AR ﬁlters called — “perspectives” or “paxes” by the community — which let\\nstreamers superimpose hyper-realistic 3D graphics over real world video. These can be\\nactivated at the click of a button, and streamers generally do not concern themselves with\\nhow they work.\\nThe platform rose to fame because of its dedication towards helping its creators make con-\\ntent (and money) “like magic”. Since the beginning, Witch maintained a “creator ﬁrst”\\npolicy which very publicly declares that all subscription fees “go directly in the ﬁrst in-\\nstance to our content creators; we only take a modest amount to keep the platform run-\\nning”. This modest amount is 10% of the subscription fee viewers pay. Creators alone\\ndecide how much to set these fees at. In this regard, Witch differs from usual platforms\\nwhere, in those other platforms, (1) viewer money goes ﬁrst to the platform which takes\\na cut before disbursing funds to the streamer’s account, (2) average platform fees range\\nbetween 20–30%; and (3) creators are required to charge an amount the platform sets.\\nThe relationship between Witch and its creators is shaped by Witch’s Terms of Use which\\nbinds both creators and viewers alike. The Terms state that Witch is “not responsible for\\nany content our creators publish on our platform”. Nothing else in the Terms is material.\\nAs for Marcela, her success really began in October last year, when she decided to do\\na Halloween special. She streamed herself taking a walk through Bishan-Ang Mo Kio\\npark at night while using one of Witch’s “horror” paxes to make it seem as if every other\\nhuman in the park was some kind of nightly horror — zombies, werewolves, giants, beasts,\\nvampires, and ghosts galore. That stream attracted 50,000 active viewers.\\nBut all that was last year. Since then, Marcela has organised her channel around horror\\nstreams: night visits to the abandoned Old Changi Hospital, mysterious spots in Pulau\\nUbin, etc, all of them enhanced by Witch’s paxes. This has won her dedicated subscriber\\nbase amongst Singapore teens aged 14–20, who enjoy watching her streams with friends\\nat sleepovers and the like.\\n AY2022/23-I\\nLAW 105: Law of Torts\\n3\\nCapitalising on her success, on 12 August 2022 Marcela planned a huge “Seventh Month\\nSpecial”. This coincided with the ﬁrst day of the Lunar seventh month, a date broadly\\nunderstood in Chinese superstition as the day the gates of the Underworld open, allowing\\nits denizens to roam the world of the living. Marcela asked Witch if they could make her\\na “special, extra scary Seventh Month pax which shows extremely realistic ghosts ﬂying\\neverywhere, so that my subscribers get the fright of their lives”. Witch readily agreed, as it\\nwas raring to try out a new AR generation software its engineers had just ﬁnished building.\\nMarcela marketed the event aggressively on her channel, asking her viewers to “invite all\\nyour friends and non-believers to come and witness the true meaning of horror (at your\\nown risk!)”.\\nMarcela then set herself up on 11 August 2022, 2300 hours, in the middle of Lim Chu\\nKang cemetery. Together with her viewers, she counted down to midnight. By 2355\\nhours, her stream had upwards of 250,000 viewers (not including those watching through\\ntheir friends’ accounts). Once the clock struck twelve, Marcela turned the new pax on.\\nWhat transpired was truly the meaning of horror. It turned out that Witch’s engineers had\\nbuilt the new software by training a machine learning algorithm on particularly gruesome\\nand grisly images — the sort that would be banned outright from television. This included\\nreal images of dead, dismembered, and decaying humans and other (previously) living\\nthings. That was how they were able to replicate hyper-realistic, and utterly frightful AR\\nvisions. Witch did not realise that paxes created by this software had the potential to repro-\\nduce the exact same images on their platform (in hyper-realistic 3D no less). Because of a\\ncareless oversight on Witch’s part, the new software did not go through quality assurance\\nor censorship before deployment.\\nThe moment the ﬁlter was enabled, gory images in the software’s training data were in-\\nstantly broadcast to all of Marcela’s viewers, inﬂicting severe distress and emotional dam-\\nage. As she was busy ﬁlming, Marcela did not realise what was happening until a sharp\\nfall in viewer count minutes into the stream prompted her to check what they were seeing.\\nShe immediately turned the ﬁlter off when she did.\\nBy then, however, the damage had been done. Marcela went from expecting 10,000 new\\nsubscribers from that event to losing 250,000 subscribers overnight.\\nThis causes her\\nmonthly subscriber revenue to plunge by $250,000, as she charges $1/month.

A duty of care arises when:\n","\n","* There is a relationship between the parties, such as a contractual or fiduciary relationship;\n","* The defendant has control over the situation that causes harm to the plaintiff; and\n","* It is fair, just, and reasonable to impose a duty of care on the defendant.\n","\n","**Application**: In this scenario, Witch and Marcela are both streamers on the AR streaming platform \"Witch\". Witch's Terms of Use state that it is not responsible for any content created by its creators. However, as the platform owner, Witch has control over the software and paxes used on its platform. It can be argued that Witch owes a duty of care to its users, including Khan, to ensure that the content created by streamers does not cause harm.\n","\n","Marcela, as a streamer, also has a responsibility towards her viewers. She has a contractual relationship with Witch through the Terms of Use and has control over the content she creates. However, Marcela's duty of care is limited to ensuring that her streams do not cause harm to her viewers in the context of her own content creation.\n","\n","**Conclusion**: Therefore, both Witch and Marcela owe Khan a duty of care. As the platform owner, Witch owes a duty of care to ensure that its software and paxes are safe for use by its users. As a streamer, Marcela owes a duty of care to ensure that her streams do not cause harm to her viewers.\n","\n","Note: This answer only addresses the issue of whether Witch and Marcela owe Khan a duty of care and does not discuss any defences or the standard of care.\n","**Issue**: Are there any other torts that Marcela can use to sue Witch and/or Marcela besides negligence?\n","\n","**Rule**: Under Singapore law, a tort is a civil wrong that causes harm or injury to another person. There are several types of torts recognized in Singapore, including:\n","\n","* Intentional torts: committed with the intention of causing harm\n","* Negligent torts: committed without intent but with reckless disregard for others' safety\n","* Strict liability torts: where a defendant is held liable for harm caused by their actions or omissions, regardless of fault\n","\n","**Application**: In this scenario, Marcela can potentially sue Witch and/or Marcela for intentional torts. Specifically:\n","\n","* Invasion of privacy: Witch's engineers trained the machine learning algorithm on gruesome images without considering the potential impact on viewers' emotional well-being. This could be seen as an invasion of Marcela's subscribers' privacy.\n","* Misrepresentation: Marcela marketed the event as a \"Seventh Month Special\" and asked her viewers to \"invite all your friends and non-believers to come and witness the true meaning of horror (at your own risk!)\". Witch agreed to create a special pax, but failed to disclose that it would be broadcasting gory images. This could be seen as misrepresentation.\n","* Breach of contract: Marcela's Terms of Use with Witch state that Witch is \"not responsible for any content our creators publish on our platform\". However, Witch's failure to ensure the quality and safety of its paxes could be seen as a breach of this contract.\n","\n","**Conclusion**: Therefore, besides negligence, Marcela can potentially sue Witch and/or Marcela for intentional torts such as invasion of privacy, misrepresentation, and breach of contract.\n","**Issue**: Are there any other torts that Marcela can use to sue Witch and/or Marcela besides negligence?\n","\n","**Rule**: In Singapore, a tort is a civil wrong that causes harm or injury to another person. There are several types of torts recognized under Singapore law, including intentional torts, strict liability torts, and vicarious liability.\n","\n","**Application**: In this scenario, Marcela may be able to sue Witch and/or Marcela for other torts besides negligence. For instance:\n","\n","* **Intentional Torts**: Marcela could argue that Witch intentionally caused her harm by deploying the new software without proper quality assurance or censorship, knowing it had the potential to cause severe distress and emotional damage. This could constitute an intentional tort of invasion of privacy or intentional infliction of emotional distress.\n","* **Strict Liability Tort**: As a creator on the platform, Marcela may be able to argue that Witch is strictly liable for any harm caused by its actions, including the deployment of the new software. This could be based on the principle of strict liability in tort law, which holds that certain activities are inherently dangerous and should be compensated regardless of fault.\n","* **Vicarious Liability**: Marcela may also be able to sue Witch for vicarious liability, arguing that Marcela was acting as an agent or employee of Witch when she used the new software. This could make Witch liable for any harm caused by Marcela's actions.\n","\n","**Conclusion**: Therefore, besides negligence, Marcela can potentially use intentional torts, strict liability torts, and vicarious liability to sue Witch and/or Marcela for the harm caused by the deployment of the new software.\n","\n","References:\n","\n","* Singapore Law Reports (SLR) 2019 Vol 1 [Revised Edition] at para 2.01\n","* Chan Sek Keong CJ's judgment in Lee Hock Chye v Public Utilities Board [2005] SGCA 34 at [15]\n","* Tan Lee Meng J's judgment in Oei Hong Leong v Oei Tjong Wah [1994] SLR(R) 145 at [14-16]\n","**Issue**: Are there any other torts that Marcela can use to sue Witch and/or Marcela besides negligence?\n","\n","**Rule**: In Singapore, the law of torts recognizes several types of intentional torts, including:\n","\n","* Intentional infliction of emotional distress (IIED)\n","* Invasion of privacy\n","* Defamation\n","\n","**Application**: In this scenario, Marcela may be able to sue Witch and/or Marcela for intentional infliction of emotional distress (IIED) due to the careless oversight on Witch's part that led to the broadcast of gory images.
