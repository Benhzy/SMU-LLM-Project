Her husband Kwan, also 38, does investments and trading at a local\nbank. The two had recently gotten married in Jan 2020.\nOn 1 Feb 2020, they moved into a 3 storey landed bungalow they had bought in the Katong\narea. The house is one of those nice heritage houses with a long colonial history. It\nwas designed and built in 1940 by Due South Ltd, now a big listed Singapore property\ndeveloper. Aisya and Kwan (henceforth \u201cA&K\u201d) are the \ufb01fth owners of the house. They\nof\ufb01cially took over ownership on 31 Oct 2019.\nBefore moving in, they engaged Safe Interiors Pte Ltd (\u201cSI\u201d), an interior design and furni-\nture company, to plan and also implement a series of renovations. This included building\na new wall fountain in their living room (the sort where water \ufb02ows down along a fea-\nture wall and into a pool). To preserve the heritage feel of the house, A&K asked that SI\nconstruct the fountain on an existing 3-metre long stretch of heritage wall that lined their\nliving room. SI inserts some water pipes and pumps in the wall to make this happen. They\nalso add some claddings to the heritage wall. The $200,000 contract between A&K and\nSI does not contain any relevant exclusion clause.\nA&K\u2019s discussions with SI took place over Nov 2019. From 1 Dec 2019 to 31 Jan 2020, SI\ncordoned off the house as a construction site, putting up the usual barriers and warnings,\nand carried out the renovations. From time to time SI would invite A&K over to have a\nlook at the progress, and A&K would give some creative direction and feedback.\nUnfortunately for the newlyweds, their new life together was fraught with twists and turns.\nWithin a month of moving in, they received a lawyer\u2019s letter from one Tommy, a 24 year\nold photographer who specialises in taking pictures for interior design magazines. On\n15 Jan 2020, SI had closed but forgotten to lock the construction site gate. The wind\nwas very strong that day and so blew the gate ajar. Passing by outside, Tommy spied a\nbeautifully renovated colonial house and ventured in to take a few pictures. Tommy did\nnot however notice a long electrical wire that was carelessly strewn across the \ufb02oor. He\n AY2020/21-II\nLAW 105: Law of Torts\n3\ntripped, dropping and breaking his $10,000 camera. Because his camera was broken, he\nalso had to miss the photoshoot he was heading to that day, making for lost pro\ufb01ts of a\nfurther $25,000. He is now demanding compensation for both from A&K only.\nAround Feb 2020, parts of the wall fountain started breaking off and falling into the pool\nbelow. It turned out that the original heritage wall as designed and built by Due South was\ndefective. The result is that it would easily disintegrate if some weight was placed on it.\nThere was nothing wrong with SI\u2019s fountain or the materials they used. But because A&K\nhad speci\ufb01cally asked for the fountain to be built on that wall, SI did not check whether\nthe wall was suitable for a wall fountain to begin with. A&K will need to pay $100,000\nto re-do the entire wall and wall fountain. They are hoping to claim compensation for this\nfrom either Due South or SI or both.\nFinally, within days of moving in, the couple starting hearing strange noises and having\nstrange sightings in the house.

        "scenario": "Twenty-eight year old Marcela is a streamer who has built a sizeable fan base (of around\n500,000 subscribers) on the augmented reality (AR) streaming platform \u201cWitch\u201d. The\nplatform was founded 6 years ago and is based in Singapore. Its main selling point is a\nrange of AR \ufb01lters called \u2014 \u201cperspectives\u201d or \u201cpaxes\u201d by the community \u2014 which let\nstreamers superimpose hyper-realistic 3D graphics over real world video. These can be\nactivated at the click of a button, and streamers generally do not concern themselves with\nhow they work.\nThe platform rose to fame because of its dedication towards helping its creators make con-\ntent (and money) \u201clike magic\u201d. Since the beginning, Witch maintained a \u201ccreator \ufb01rst\u201d\npolicy which very publicly declares that all subscription fees \u201cgo directly in the \ufb01rst in-\nstance to our content creators; we only take a modest amount to keep the platform run-\nning\u201d. This modest amount is 10% of the subscription fee viewers pay. Creators alone\ndecide how much to set these fees at. In this regard, Witch differs from usual platforms\nwhere, in those other platforms, (1) viewer money goes \ufb01rst to the platform which takes\na cut before disbursing funds to the streamer\u2019s account, (2) average platform fees range\nbetween 20\u201330%; and (3) creators are required to charge an amount the platform sets.\nThe relationship between Witch and its creators is shaped by Witch\u2019s Terms of Use which\nbinds both creators and viewers alike. The Terms state that Witch is \u201cnot responsible for\nany content our creators publish on our platform\u201d. Nothing else in the Terms is material.\nAs for Marcela, her success really began in October last year, when she decided to do\na Halloween special. She streamed herself taking a walk through Bishan-Ang Mo Kio\npark at night while using one of Witch\u2019s \u201chorror\u201d paxes to make it seem as if every other\nhuman in the park was some kind of nightly horror \u2014 zombies, werewolves, giants, beasts,\nvampires, and ghosts galore. That stream attracted 50,000 active viewers.\nBut all that was last year. Since then, Marcela has organised her channel around horror\nstreams: night visits to the abandoned Old Changi Hospital, mysterious spots in Pulau\nUbin, etc, all of them enhanced by Witch\u2019s paxes. This has won her dedicated subscriber\nbase amongst Singapore teens aged 14\u201320, who enjoy watching her streams with friends\nat sleepovers and the like.\n AY2022/23-I\nLAW 105: Law of Torts\n3\nCapitalising on her success, on 12 August 2022 Marcela planned a huge \u201cSeventh Month\nSpecial\u201d. This coincided with the \ufb01rst day of the Lunar seventh month, a date broadly\nunderstood in Chinese superstition as the day the gates of the Underworld open, allowing\nits denizens to roam the world of the living. Marcela asked Witch if they could make her\na \u201cspecial, extra scary Seventh Month pax which shows extremely realistic ghosts \ufb02ying\neverywhere, so that my subscribers get the fright of their lives\u201d. Witch readily agreed, as it\nwas raring to try out a new AR generation software its engineers had just \ufb01nished building.\nMarcela marketed the event aggressively on her channel, asking her viewers to \u201cinvite all\nyour friends and non-believers to come and witness the true meaning of horror (at your\nown risk!)\u201d.\nMarcela then set herself up on 11 August 2022, 2300 hours, in the middle of Lim Chu\nKang cemetery. Together with her viewers, she counted down to midnight. By 2355\nhours, her stream had upwards of 250,000 viewers (not including those watching through\ntheir friends\u2019 accounts). Once the clock struck twelve, Marcela turned the new pax on.\nWhat transpired was truly the meaning of horror. It turned out that Witch\u2019s engineers had\nbuilt the new software by training a machine learning algorithm on particularly gruesome\nand grisly images \u2014 the sort that would be banned outright from television. This included\nreal images of dead, dismembered, and decaying humans and other (previously) living\nthings. That was how they were able to replicate hyper-realistic, and utterly frightful AR\nvisions. Witch did not realise that paxes created by this software had the potential to repro-\nduce the exact same images on their platform (in hyper-realistic 3D no less). Because of a\ncareless oversight on Witch\u2019s part, the new software did not go through quality assurance\nor censorship before deployment.\nThe moment the \ufb01lter was enabled, gory images in the software\u2019s training data were in-\nstantly broadcast to all of Marcela\u2019s viewers, in\ufb02icting severe distress and emotional dam-\nage. As she was busy \ufb01lming, Marcela did not realise what was happening until a sharp\nfall in viewer count minutes into the stream prompted her to check what they were seeing.\nShe immediately turned the \ufb01lter off when she did.\nBy then, however, the damage had been done. Marcela went from expecting 10,000 new\nsubscribers from that event to losing 250,000 subscribers overnight.\nThis causes her\nmonthly subscriber revenue to plunge by $250,000, as she charges $1/month. She also\n \nAnswer all the following questions using only material covered up till and not includ-\ning the Standard of Care. You also need not discuss anything to do with defences.\n1.

If more facts\nare needed for your analysis, state them and explain why.\n AY2022/23-I\nLAW 105: Law of Torts\n4\nhad to cancel planned specials for the rest of the Seventh Month. These, she estimates,\nwould have net her another 25,000 new subscribers. To make things worse, two months\nlater she gets a lawyer\u2019s letter from Khan, who had developed a recognised psychiatric\ninjury from watching her stream. Though she is completely \ufb01ne herself, Marcela suspects\nthat many other viewers could have come down with such psychiatric injuries as well.\n* * *\nAnswer all the following questions using only material covered up till and not includ-\ning the Standard of Care.
